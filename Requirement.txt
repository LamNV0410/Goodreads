This is the problem statement for BE engineers (.Net):
You’re building a backend service to support the GoodReads mobile app. Please build a set of APIs that would allow a user to do the following activities:
1. Add a book to the list of books they have read
2. View a list of books they have completed reading
3. Search for a book by name

We’re looking only for APIs, no Frontend is needed.
Please make sure that the APIs are RESTful. 
We are looking for clean, readable code with unit tests.
